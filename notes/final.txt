rice

1.create histogram
1.1)count rice in every picture DONE
1.2)plot the numbers on histogram DONE
1.3)select the highest number of rice

options:
- manual (go with this one)
	- capture each time it stop (10 captures)
-auto
	- capture possibly shakey images (high risks)
	- sync python with arduino

4.adjust servo speed DONE
5.corrected ligthing (can't because no budget)

optional: measure sizes for the best one
